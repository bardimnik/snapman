FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
==========================

1. Why another Btrfs snapshot utility?

- There are many other utilities for backup using Btrfs snapshot features,
snapper is a good one. But Snapman is very simple mechanism, very simple to
undestand, and very simple to configure and hack. If you are happy with snapper
or other similar tool, maybe don't need Snapman. However if you want even
more simplicity it's posible you will like this program.

2. Why your english is so bad?

- My native language is spanish. I have a very basic level of english. I'm very
sorry for my english. I will be happy if you can perform a translation of the
documentation to your language.

3. Could you (please) add this X feature to the program?

- I don't know. I am not a good python programer. But if I like your proposal
I'll try to implement it in the script.

4. I like very much your software. How can I to express my gratitude to you?

- A very good option is to send me a lot of MONEY, or pay me a beer ;-). But if
you are a grateful man (or grateful *poor* man *with internet access*), I would
appreciate a thanks by mail.
