Snapman
-------

Snapman is a backup program based on the ability of Btrfs file system to
capture snapshots of subvolumes.

When you run `snapman` it will read its configuration file and then it will
make backups (snapshots) of indicated subvolumes at desired frequency until
reach a defined quota. If quota was reached, then it will remove the older
backup before to make a new one to keep the number of backups indicated in
quota.

Snapman will run periodically if you use the `--daemon` command line option.

Backups are stored in a directory specified in the configuration file.

Since version 1.0a Snapman has an integrated GUI interface. It can be 
activated using the `--gui` command line option.

For each subvolume that you want to backup you must to write at least an entry
in the configuration file (in the easy `.ini` format).

Snapman accepts command-line options to manage snapshots.

- [Snapman manual](man/en/snapman.1.md), for the manual.
